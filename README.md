## Stock Price Prediction






## Project Overview



Investors make their decisions to buy or sell stock of a company relying on their analysis of stock market indicators, in order to make the best investment. Therefore, observing the behavior of the stock price indicator every day will always be in tune with the current trend. 

For an investor to look for the path that leads him to predict the behavior of the stock price would give him the knowledge that would place him in advantage to make a satisfactory investment. However Burton Malkiel, in his influential 1973 work, A Random Walk Down Wall Street and Warren Buffett, respectively state that:



>“that stock prices could therefore not be accurately predicted by looking at price history. As a result, Malkiel argued, stock prices are best described by a statistical process called a "random walk" meaning each day's deviations from the central value are random and unpredictable” (Burton Malkiel).

>Stop trying to predict the direction of the stock market, the economy, interest rates, or elections (Warren Buffett). 

In the last two decades, the desire to make predictions about the actions of values has been the subject of study. Prediction methodologies are divided into three broad categories: 
 


- Fundamental analysis

- Technical analysis

- Machine learning

The technology in these categories has an important role because of this depends speed, consistency, timeliness, security and trust, such characteristics can support to observe and analyze thousands of transactions every day.
With the advent of the digital computer, stock market prediction has since moved into the technological realm. For this project the main objective is Implement stock predictor and builds a model of stock behavior using a method called Long short-term memory (LSTM) which are units of a recurrent neural network (RNN). Today is considered the best model to perform this task.
